# rdf-elements-play

**Not for general consumption**

I want to use/adapt components from [rdf-elements](https://github.com/rdf-ext/rdf-elements), part of [RDF-Ext](https://github.com/rdf-ext). I'm likely to create loads of junk and break things, so rather than forking for now I've just taken a clone of that repo. If I do happen to come up with anything useful, I'll feed it back there.

So ignore this.
